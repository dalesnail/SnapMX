Solidworks parts files for easy layout setup in assemblies. Will automatically place in a slot on a seperate alignment plate if that slot is a circle. 
I will include one example of a plate for this purpose to play around with, but past that you should essentially take a plate file from whatever model you're rendering, create an outline of the plate, and draw a circle in each switch slot, then extrude as another part. Extrude should be 7.63mm as this will place the keys at the correct height. 

This repo is currently extremely rough and there are some issues with some part files. The conversion folder was converted from part file, to step, to part file again, to remove the edu license on them. 
As a result, various files in the converted folder will have no legends on them, so bear with me while I track these down and re convert them. For now I've imcluded the original files, which you can grab from and use.
